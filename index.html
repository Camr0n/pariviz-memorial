    <h2>Tribute by Dr. Andrew M. Kropinski</h2>
    <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We are deeply saddened by the news of Parviz's death.  The phage world has lost an important scientist, leader, and mentor.  And those who knew him personally are grieving the loss of a ceaselessly curious, kind, generous, amusing, and inspiring friend. 

My professional relationship with Parviz began in 2004, when my wife, Peggy Pritchard, and I moved to Guelph.  I had taken up a senior scientist position in the Laboratory for Foodborne Zoonoses, which was directly across the street from Parviz's laboratory at Agriculture and Agrifood Canada's Guelph Research and Development Centre.  While serving on the same supervisory committees for graduate students from the University of Guelph, we quickly recognized that we shared a common passion for science, and commitment to mentoring the next generation of scientists. He was very adaptable, a novel thinker, and delightfully easy to work with.  Our research collaborations resulted in the publication of scientific papers and chapters in each other’s book projects.  In addition, we both attended Betty Kutter’s biennial Evergreen Phage Biology meetings, and the Viruses of Microbes conferences.  Our last conference together was in Guimarães, Portugal, in 2022.

Behind the scenes, Parviz was a discrete and respected confidante of philanthropists. His most recent consultations resulted in the establishment of a Professorship in Bacteriophage Therapy Research & Innovation at the University of Toronto, and support for The Félix d'Hérelle Reference Center for Bacterial Viruses at L'Université Laval.  These two initiatives have immeasurably strengthen applied phage research in Canada.

Parviz was a gracious host with old world charm, whose generous hospitality was extended to students and colleagues alike.  Peggy and I still recall our first visit to his comfortably furnished and decorated home.  His delicious meal included ingredients from his own garden, and our far-ranging conversation was refreshingly engaging. Thanks to Parviz, Peggy and I have a modest collection of hand-woven carpets, and an enviable amount of Iranian saffron!

A few years ago, Peggy began a PhD in Population Medicine at the Ontario Veterinary College.  Parviz's delight and support meant a the world to her.  She was looking forward to him attending her graduation.

The consummate teacher and story-teller, Parviz spoke knowledgeably about a wide range of subjects from phage therapy and epigenetics to Persian poets.  As I came to know Parviz better, and learn more about his life, I was in awe of what he experienced and achieved.  He had lived an unbelievably full life--scientifically and personally--and I was convinced that he either started graduate school at the age of five, or was 110 when he retired!

It felt as though our dear friend could live forever but, sadly, not so.  We are sorry we didn't have the opportunity to wish you a "Happy Nowruz!" this year, Parviz.

    <h2>Tribute from 3 Iranian Scientific Societies</h2>
    <blockquote>
  “Unfortunately, the Iranian-Canadian scientific and cultural community has lost one of its scientific honors”
</blockquote>

<p>Professor Dr. Parviz Sabour, a professor at the universities of Tehran and Canada and one of the founders of modern genetics in Iran, left the Iranian scientific and cultural community and said goodbye to life.</p>

<p>After his doctoral studies at the University of California, Berkeley, Professor Dr. Sabour returned to Iran in 1969 and taught at the National University of Iran and the University of Tehran. Dr. Sabour was one of the founders of the Institute of Biophysics and Biochemistry (IBB) at the Faculty of Science of the University of Tehran and trained many students in the field of molecular genetics. Dr. Sabour conducted extensive research in molecular genetics in Iran and the United States in collaboration with Harvard University.</p>

<p>After the Iranian Revolution, Dr. Sabour moved to Canada and taught at the Universities of Ottawa and Carleton. Then he conducted research at the Research Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in Ottawa. In 1997, he joined the Research Centre at Guelph Research Park and collaborated with the Faculty of Food Science at the University of Guelph. Dr. Sabour published more than 190 scientific articles and books and delivered hundreds of lectures in scientific societies across Canada and the United States.</p>

<p>He was a member of prestigious societies in Canada and the United States, as well as a prominent member of the Canadian-Iranian Society of Food and Nutrition, the Society of Knowledge, and the Iranian-Canadian Engineers Association, offering valuable scientific lectures to the Iranian scientific community.</p>

<p>We offer our condolences to the Iranian intellectual community and nation on the passing of this wise and learned scientist and extend our heartfelt wishes for strength and comfort to his loved ones.</p>

  <h2>Eulogy by Azadeh Sabour</h2>
  <h3>Eulogy for Dr. Parviz Mohammad Sabour, by Azadeh Sabour</h3>

  <p>My father was just a few days shy of his 89th birthday when he drew his last breath. We used to joke that Parviz had nine lives, because he escaped death so many times throughout his life. It’s still truly hard to believe that he’s gone in an instant. I miss him very much.</p>

  <p>He was so vibrant and busy—living life on his own terms, with so much determination, right up to his final days. He was baking bread and making stews, germinating seeds in his greenhouse to plant at his farm, and planning his latest trip to Iran, his home country, which he loved so much. He was developing research proposals with other scientists, funding lab research, and still giving scientific lectures, to name just a few of his passions.</p>

  <p>There are moments when grief overwhelms me. I’ve spent hours at his home, surrounded by photographs and mementos, reading your kind messages, and marveling at the stories and pictures you’ve shared.</p>

  <p>I am deeply grateful for each memory and message—from friends, family, and colleagues around the world. My brothers and I are blessed by our mother’s loving support, by friends helping us plan this celebration, by my husband Chris’s beautiful photo reels, and by family and friends joining us from afar. With all of you, we are weaving a tapestry of our father’s life. Day by day, I am climbing upward and forward, discovering the beauty in his vibrant, remarkable story.</p>

  <p>Today, I want to share that story with you. And as I do, I hope you’ll imagine him here—our professor—correcting my details, going off on tangents, smiling his biggest smile, and sharing his deep, joyful laugh.</p>

  <p>My father was born Mohammad Sabour in April 1936, the youngest of three brothers, in Nowbahar (now the bustling city of Mashhad), Khorasan, northeastern Iran.</p>

  <p>Those early years were unimaginably hard. My father’s mother loved her children so deeply, but the hardships of life meant she was unable to care for her three sons on her own. The boys were sent to live with relatives in Tehran. My father, still a baby, was adopted by a prominent judge and his wife who named him Parviz and raised him through adolescence. That family had a son, Farzad, who now lives in Frankfurt and remained close to my father. Parviz also stayed close with his birth mother and brothers—his eldest brother Hussein passed away in the 1980s, while Ali Asghar, now in his nineties, lives in Montreal.</p>

  <p>Life in Tehran was also hard. He was three at the start of World War II, and five when British and Soviet forces—with help from the U.S.—invaded and occupied Iran in 1941. Combined with a poor harvest, this led to a devastating famine between 1942 and 1944.</p>

  <p>In the post-war rebuilding of the 1950s and ’60s, Iran received international assistance—from USAID and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization—to improve agricultural practices and education. This support would go on to shape my father’s life.</p>

  <p>At 19, he completed a diploma at the Agricultural Teachers Training School in Varāmīn, preparing educators to advance rural development. He excelled academically, soon becoming Farm Manager at an experimental vegetable and poultry farm, then Agriculture and Poultry Specialist at the Ministry of Agriculture in Rasht.</p>

  <p>His success earned him a place at Utah State University, where he earned a B.Sc. in Zoology in 1963, and then at the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed a Ph.D. in Genetics. Berkeley in the 1960s was alive with progressive politics, civil rights, and the anti-Vietnam War movement—my father was passionately anti-war and documented many protests with his camera.</p>

  <p>He formed lifelong friendships there—among them Dale Whiteside, a Canadian lab researcher learning Farsi. They traveled together to Iran in 1969, and Dale later joined Canada’s foreign service. Their bond, and her family’s kindness, would eventually help us flee the 1979 Revolution and Iraqi invasion, first to Cairo, then to Canada.</p>

  <p>In January 1974, Parviz married my mother, Nahid, and our family soon grew with my brother Arash and me. He co-founded the Institute of Biophysics and Biochemistry at the University of Tehran, training many future scientists. After the Revolution, we escaped to Canada, where he joined Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada and taught at universities including Ottawa, Carleton, Guelph, Purdue, and Harvard.</p>

  <p>He published over 190 papers, gave hundreds of lectures worldwide, and was a founding member of Phage Canada—but to us, he was “Professor of Love,” teaching us about yogurts, kefir, ginger tea, backgammon, gardens, and the cosmic wonders of a blackout night sky.</p>

  <p>Hours after his sudden death, my brother Camron and I walked his beloved farm and found retro gadgets, cameras, and even an astronaut’s exercise machine—each a story, each a lesson, each delivered with that gleam in his eye.</p>

  <p>I will hold onto his story, his love, and his lessons. When I hear Maria Callas, drink my kefir, water his plants, or smell his hats, he’s with me. My family and I thank you all for joining us today to celebrate his remarkable life.</p>

      <h2>Tribute by Fiona McKean</h2>
      <p>What I will miss most about Parviz is his voice. If you close your eyes and really listen, I’m sure you can hear him:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>He’s telling you to put high-fat plain yogurt on that skin condition you’ve been ignoring.</li>
        <li>He’s explaining how phages kill viruses without harming other cells.</li>
        <li>He’s telling you to make your own ginger tea instead of buying the packets because really, Fiona, you’re losing most of the benefit once it’s in a mass-produced pack (fine! I’ll make my own ginger tea, Amu).</li>
        <li>He’s showing you how to make the best bread you’ve ever tasted.</li>
        <li>He’s telling your teenaged self to think from first principles and not follow blindly.</li>
        <li>He’s sharing the story, for the 500th time, about sailing to America and ending up at university in Utah living with a Mormon family and raising chickens for 25 cents an hour. Even in repetition, it’s still funny.</li>
        <li>He’s telling you that he loves you. He was so open with his love.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Love of life, love of humanity, love of curiosity. He was a Professor of love.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What a lovely voice, <br>
           Teaching us of life<br>
           Biology, virology, a history of strife.<br>
           Wondrous, ponderous <br>
           Calm and filled with resonance<br>
           A Professor of Love eternal.</p>

      <h2>Poetry Reading by Sepand Siassi &amp; Meghan Hanley</h2>
      <p><strong>Introduction to Persian Poetry:</strong><br>
       
<div class="section" id="poetry">
  <h2>Poetry Reading by Sepand Siassi &amp; Meghan Hanley</h2>
  <h3>Introduction to Persian Poetry</h3>

  <h4>Sepand Siassi</h4>
  <p>My name is Sepand Siassi. My parents, Dr. Fereydoun Siassi and Shahed Amiri, have been very close friends with Parviz since the early ’70s. My father met Parviz through mutual friends at the University of Tehran while Parviz was working at the Institute of Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics. Our families have been very close for three generations, in Iran and in Canada. I’ve traveled from Barcelona, where I now live, to be here with you today and to represent my family.</p>

  <p>“Amu Parviz” was like an uncle to my brother and me, and we both love him dearly. Throughout the day, I am constantly reminded of his wisdom—whether it was a microscopic explanation of what happens when you brush your teeth or a story about drinking a glass of kefir. He showed me how to make yogurt, how to manage my road rage…EVERY TIME I see an insect, I’m reminded of his gentle voice telling me this was their home long before it became mine. I continue to cherish the beautiful citrus tree he bought as a gift for the birth of my son.</p>

  <p>He was not only one of the smartest people I knew, but also one of the kindest—truly gentle and deeply caring—and I miss him dearly.</p>

  <h4>Meghan Hanley</h4>
  <p>My name is Meghan Hanley. I first met Parviz at Dale, Bruce, and Fiona’s house in Ottawa over 20 years ago. That first night, he taught me that the best rice is at the bottom of the pot and had the whole table enraptured by his near-death story. Parviz became part of the fabric of my life—and the lives of my children. He taught us to move slowly, observe deeply, ask “why,” and have faith in the smallest seedling.</p>

  <p>Two years ago, Parviz gave us a small mulberry tree he’d grown from a cutting. Days after he died, I realized I’d left it out all winter, unprotected. It looked lifeless. I scratched the bark—green! I placed it in the sun, fertilized and watered it. Its leaves popped out yesterday. Life. Amu, I promise I’ll care for it.</p>

  <p>Sepand and I are here to share a selection of Persian poems with you. Among the many things Parviz loved about Iran was its poetry. As I began reading the poets he knew so well, Dale said spontaneously: <em>“In Iran, poetry is life!”</em> Poetry is not just read—it’s quoted in conversation, inscribed on buildings, woven into carpets, and recited at gatherings like today.</p>

  <p>Persian poetry is the soul of its culture—deeply expressive and intertwined with daily life. Parviz’s favourites included the centuries-old Hafez, Rumi, and Ferdowsi, and he deeply admired Omar Khayyam’s <em>Rubáiyát</em>. We will read a selection of quatrains (four-line poems) in Farsi, with translations in English.</p>

  <h4>Quatrain 1</h4>
  <p><em>[Sepand reads Quatrain 1 in Farsi]</em></p>
  <p><strong>Meghan (Literal translation):</strong> [Insert literal English translation here]</p>
  <p><strong>Meghan (Fitzgerald translation):</strong> [Insert Fitzgerald’s lyrical version here]</p>

  <h4>Quatrain 2</h4>
  <p><em>[Sepand reads Quatrain 2 in Farsi]</em></p>
  <p><strong>Meghan (English translation):</strong><br>
     “A cloud came and wept more over the grass<br>
      Without rose-coloured wine, life cannot pass<br>
      This grass that today is our place of delight<br>
      Whose dust will it be, when our time has passed?”</p>

  <h4>Quatrain 3</h4>
  <p><em>[Sepand reads Quatrain 3 in Farsi]</em></p>
  <p><strong>Meghan (English translation):</strong><br>
     “With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow,<br>
      And with mine own hand labored it to grow;<br>
      And this was all the Harvest that I reap’d—<br>
      ‘I came like Water, and like Wind I go.’”</p>

  <p>It’s incredible that these quatrains ring true hundreds of years later.</p>

  <p>We close with a modern interpretation inspired by Ferdowsi—author of the 11th-century epic <em>Shahnameh</em> (“The Book of Kings”). Though not a literal translation, this poem echoes Ferdowsi’s themes of legacy, honour, and the enduring power of a good name.</p>

  <h2>Speech by Dean Lucie Thibault</h2>
  <h3>University of Ottawa: Nutrition Sciences &amp; Gut Microbiome</h3>

  <p>At the University of Ottawa, we share Parviz’s passion for understanding the role of the gut microbiome in health—and in mental health in particular. His support and advocacy meant a great deal to our Faculty of Health Sciences as we built, from scratch, a new School of Nutrition Sciences and both undergraduate and graduate food-science programs.</p>

  <p>This massive undertaking—led by Susan Tosh (who, like Krista, was a long-time colleague and friend of Parviz)—involved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Designing and launching new courses</li>
    <li>Building state-of-the-art teaching and research laboratories</li>
    <li>Developing a collaborative research agenda to explore how diet, nutrition, and the gut microbiome influence depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thanks to these efforts, we successfully attracted a critical mass of young researchers from diverse fields to drive breakthroughs in nutrition-and-mental-health research.</p>

  <p>Today, I am honored to announce that the University will name two scholarships in Parviz’s memory:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dr. Parviz Sabour Nutrition and Mental Health Doctoral Scholarship</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Dr. Parviz Sabour Nutrition and Mental Health Master’s Scholarship</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>These awards are a fitting tribute to Parviz—a man of science who was always curious, always learning, and always caring for his students. His legacy will live on through every student these scholarships support.</p>

      <h2>Speech by Dr. Greg German</h2>
  <h3>Phages &amp; Parviz: A Legacy of Impact</h3>

  <p>Good afternoon. I am <strong>Dr. Greg German</strong>, co‑founder of Phage Canada, physician, and Professor of Bacteriophage Therapy at the University of Toronto.</p>

  <p>Parviz was a phage in many ways. Phages are bacterial viruses that specifically target harmful bacteria, replicating at the site of infection to produce 60–300 new phages. In that metaphor, Parviz would have been the 300—expanding his positive impact exponentially.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Phages target bad bacteria and multiply locally, amplifying their effect.</li>
    <li>Parviz always had a pulse on where to do the greatest good and spread knowledge.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Dr. Hany Anany</strong> (Agriculture &amp; Agri‑Food Canada, who succeeded Parviz’s lab in Guelph) is here today with five colleagues. He shares:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Your light, your generosity, and your spirit… Parviz had a way of making everyone around him feel seen, valued, and inspired. His deep knowledge, humility, and warmth touched so many lives—mine perhaps most deeply. Your legacy will continue in every step I take and in every student and project touched by your influence.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Like phages, which out‑evolve bacteria, Parviz out‑evolved with the times—always thinking three moves ahead, solving challenges with kindness and a disarming approach.</p>

  <p>Also attending is <strong>Dr. Andrew Kropinski</strong> with his wife, Ms. Peggy Pritchard, who offer:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Ceaselessly curious, kind, generous, amusing, and inspiring friend. Gracious host with old‑world charm. Discrete and respected philanthropy advisor and contributor… leading to major work in microbiome research and precision tools to modify the microbiome through phage therapy.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Parviz was a connector and catalyst—linking those hungry for science with those ready for action. Phages penetrate places antibiotics can’t—like prosthetic joints—and persist. Parviz provided that spark countless times. He was also the first member of Phage Canada, generously funding our growth from a handful to over 70 members.</p>

  <p>Phages are timeless—pre‑antibiotic, companies like Eli Lilly, Abbott, and the Pasteur Institute produced phages to treat infections. Parviz encouraged us all to “grow,” much like the pomegranate (Anar) he cherished as a symbol of fertility, blessings, and anti‑aging. He often carried seeds with him on his travels, nurturing both plants and people.</p>

  <p>My research team recently submitted a groundbreaking Canadian clinical trial on urinary tract infections for publication. If accepted, it will be offered in Parviz’s honour and memory.</p>

  <p>We have lost one of our most dedicated champions of goodness and knowledge, but his memory, his legacy, his smile lives on in us and all whom we touch.</p>

  <p><em>Phage on, Parviz.</em></p>

  <h3>Mentorship &amp; Scientific Collaboration</h3>

  <p>Hello everyone. My name is <strong>Dr. Krista Power</strong>, and I’m honoured to speak alongside Dean Lucie Thibault of uOttawa’s Faculty of Health Sciences.</p>

  <p>Before sharing my memories of Parviz, I want to express my deepest condolences to his family and friends. It’s a privilege to join you in celebrating the life of such a remarkable person.</p>

  <h4>Early Encounters &amp; Mentorship</h4>
  <p>I first met Parviz at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s Guelph Food Research Centre in spring 2008, when I joined as a research scientist fresh from my graduate studies. Nervous and uncertain, I was fortunate to be assigned an office next to Parviz. His door was always open; his warmth and genuine curiosity quickly made him both mentor and friend.</p>

  <p>He possessed a unique ability to connect ideas across disciplines, guiding my research on fiber-rich plant foods and their impact on health. Daily discussions in his office shaped my work in new and exciting directions.</p>

  <h4>Collaborations &amp; Contributions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Influenced my research program on diet–microbiome interactions through his expertise in the gut microbiome.</li>
    <li>Pioneered bacteriophage alternatives to antibiotics, advancing food safety and sustainability.</li>
    <li>Supported the establishment of uOttawa’s nutrition, microbiome, and mental health research agenda after my transition to academia.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Final Moments &amp; Enduring Legacy</h4>
  <p>In March of this year, Parviz joined us for Nutrition Research Day at uOttawa. He toured our new facilities with genuine excitement, engaged students with thoughtful questions, and left everyone smiling. His enthusiasm for science and his care for students remain an inspiration.</p>

  <p>Parviz will be deeply missed by me and by so many whose lives and work he touched. His legacy lives on through the researchers he mentored, the programs he helped build, and the curiosity he ignited in all of us.</p>

    <p>باور نمی‌کند دل من مرگ دوست را<br>
       نه نه من این یقین را<br>
       باور نمی‌کنم</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am <strong>Dr. Roya Riazi</strong>, President of CSIFNS, and I have the honour today to share a few words celebrating the extraordinary life of Dr. Sabour—a brilliant scientist, dedicated mentor, and above all, a cherished friend and human being.</p>

  <p>Dr. Sabour was, in every sense, a guiding light—professionally and personally. Despite his many achievements, he never boasted. Instead, he shared his wisdom generously—through quiet conversations, kind words of encouragement, and by leading by example. He taught us not just the science, but the importance of perseverance, humility, and the joy of meaningful work.</p>

  <p>Beyond his professional life, Dr. Sabour was a true friend: someone you could always count on, who listened without judgment, supported without hesitation, and showed kindness in both grand and subtle ways.</p>

  <p>His legacy lives on not only through his discoveries and research contributions, but in the countless lives he touched and hearts he inspired—especially his beloved children.</p>

  <p>As we say goodbye today, let us remember the many ways Dr. Sabour made us better—not just as professionals, but as human beings. Thank you, Dr. Sabour, for everything. You will be missed, but never forgotten.</p>

       <h2>Speech by Dr. Susan Tosh</h2>
  <h3>Building Nutrition Sciences &amp; Mental Health Research</h3>

  <p>Hello, I am <strong>Dr. Susan Tosh</strong>. I recently retired from the University of Ottawa, where I served as Director of the School of Nutrition Sciences.</p>

  <h4>Early Collaboration</h4>
  <p>When I became a research scientist at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s Guelph Food Research Centre, I was assigned the office beside Parviz’s. We spent countless hours discussing our research plans and objectives. He taught me invaluable lessons on gut microbiota and genetics.</p>

  <h4>Establishing uOttawa’s Nutrition Program</h4>
  <p>About two months after I transitioned to the University of Ottawa to establish a new School of Nutrition Sciences, Parviz visited to offer guidance:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>He recommended a research focus on the linkage between gut microbiota and mental health.</li>
    <li>He assisted us in securing support for that objective.</li>
    <li>He made a generous personal donation to equip our labs and fund student research.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thanks to his support, our School quickly became a leader in nutrition and mental health research.</p>

  <h4>Memorable Moments</h4>
  <p>On <time datetime="2025-03-27">March 27, 2025</time>, I shared dinner with Parviz, Meghan Hanley, and Krista Power. Parviz was energetic, sharing stories and laughter. The next day at Nutrition Research Day, he engaged with students, asked insightful questions, and ended the event with a warm hug—all just three days before his sudden passing.</p>

  <h4>Honoring His Legacy</h4>
  <p>I will always remember Parviz as a dedicated scientist who truly cared for student learning and advancement. It is my pleasure to announce that the University of Ottawa will name two scholarships in his honour:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dr. Parviz Sabour Nutrition and Mental Health Doctoral Scholarship</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Dr. Parviz Sabour Nutrition and Mental Health Master’s Scholarship</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>— Dr. Susan Tosh,<br>
  Retired Professor, University of Ottawa<br>
  Former Research Scientist, Agriculture &amp; Agri-Food Canada’s Guelph Food Research Centre</p>

    <p>هر آن کس که ز مادر زاد است بمرد<br>
       ز دست اجل هیچ کس جان نبرد</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Though Parviz is no longer among us, he lives on in our souls and minds through countless memories and legacies.</p>

  <p>As Ferdowsi reminds us, only one’s record remains—and Dr. Sabour’s record in science and humanity is exceptionally honorable. His name is inscribed with dignity in the chronicle of history.</p>

  <h4>Words of Khwaja Shiraz</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>بر این رواق پرچین نوشته‌اند به زر<br>
       که جز نیکی اهل کرم نخواهد ماند</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h4>Persian Verse</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>گلچین روزگار عجب خوش سلیقه است<br>
       می‌چیند آن گلی که به عالم نمونه است</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>در گذشت پروفسور پرویز صبور استاد برجسته دانشگاه و دانشمند علم ژنتیک، همه ما را در ماتمی عمیق فرو برد. همه کسانی که از نزدیک با او آشنا بودند علاوه بر شخصیت علمی و فرزانگی بی‌بدیل او، بر پاک‌دلی و صفای باطن او نیز شهادت خواهند داد. کانون مهندس در گذشت این استاد برجسته، که به‌حق یکی از مفاخر علمی ما ایرانیان خارج‌کشور بود، به همه دوستان، آشنایان، و جامعه علمی ایرانیان داخل و خارج کشور تسلیت می‌گوید و خود را در این سوگ شریک می‌داند.</p>

  <h2>Eulogy by Camron Sabour</h2>
  <h3>Eulogy for Dad — Speaking Notes</h3>

  <p>Dad was known for his zest for life, his hard work, his compassion, and his commitment to his friends and family.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes, I won't be able to represent the totality of his life, but I will share some stories and visceral memories of my dad.</p>

  <p>To teach me hard work, he told me about his life — how he came on a boat to Utah from Iran.</p>

  <p>Before leaving Iran, many friends and family gave him money for his travels and tuition. Those people are the enablers of his life, and for that, I am eternally grateful — for giving Dad a chance — his big shot in the Western world.</p>

  <p>That being said, Dad being Dad, he wasn't particularly great at managing his funds. He told me he spent too much of his money on gifts for people in America.</p>

  <p>By the time he finally arrived at the University of Utah, his money had gotten so low I think he could barely afford his first tuition payments.</p>

  <p>To support himself, he worked on a poultry farm.</p>

  <p>He described his hardships: unable to buy regular food, relying on donated eggs from the chickens he raised, making ash from the chicken feed, and living on the farm where he worked.</p>

  <p>He got to classes by bicycle — something that society looked down upon at the time. He described how drivers, usually in pickup trucks, would yell at him as they drove by, harassing him for riding his bike to school.</p>

  <p>On his first math test, he was shocked at how poorly he did. From that moment on, he became determined to be the best in his class.</p>

  <p>He would stay up late after working all day on the farm, keeping his feet in cold water to stay awake while finishing his math assignments.</p>

  <p>Assignments were due first thing in the morning, and he was proud to say that he graduated at the top of his class.</p>

  <p>After he finished his undergrad, he went to Berkeley for his PhD.</p>

  <p>He described how his work ethic had changed — he was more into extracurricular activities and a little less focused than at Utah.</p>

  <p>But his brilliance was unmatched.</p>

  <p>He developed new techniques in science, becoming world-famous for injecting DNA directly into the nucleus of a cell.</p>

  <p>His PhD was groundbreaking — the discovery of honeybee genetics, specifically how feeding royal jelly to larvae produces queens.</p>

  <p>Here are some visceral memories of my dad — a scientist and a rebel, like Freeman Dyson.</p>

  <p>When I was a kid, maybe three or four years old, I asked my dad if it would be okay to eat ants. Being the scientist that he was, wanting to teach me about survival and nutrition, he said people around the world do eat ants — and that it was safe.</p>

  <p>So when I was in the garden, I tried to eat ants. They were way too acidic. I don't recommend it.</p>

  <p>He also encouraged me to grow things in the garden — like squash.</p>

  <p>I remember Dad singing Persian songs to me.</p>

  <p>One of them went something like this — a kids' game where you have to raise your hand before the meal when the singer says, "Who wants some bread and cheese?"<br>
     Tap tap khamir,<br>
     shishe por panir,<br>
     dasto ki bala.</p>

  <p>I remember the feeling of being saved by Dad.</p>

  <p>When I was crawling under the fence at 55 McLeod — not far from here — I got stuck. After crying for help, Dad came, assessed the situation, got some butter to lubricate my ears, and after about ten minutes of fiddling, he saved me.</p>

  <p>It’s one of my earliest memories of Dad.</p>

  <p>When Dad told me stories about his childhood, he talked about sitting at the korsi — a heated table with a heavy blanket, surrounded by family, eating, studying, doing homework, celebrating nights like Shab-e Yalda — the winter solstice.</p>

  <p>I remember the smell and sound of adventure, riding with Dad in the Yellow Submarine — his old VW Westfalia camper.</p>

  <p>Does anyone else remember that thing?</p>

  <p>I remember the smell and taste of fresh peaches we filled the camper with from a government farm. They weren’t allowed to be sold at the market — they were experimental research peaches — but they were absolutely delicious. We ate them all year, because Dad was so resourceful about preserving food.</p>

  <p>About the camper — it was a lovely thing he was proud of, though sometimes he did get a little embarrassed showing up at fancy doctor events, where everyone else drove Mercedes. Sometimes it was called the pet-pet machine for the strange sounds it made in a world of modern cars.</p>

  <p>The smell of walnut trees...</p>

  <p>At his lab — the Ottawa Laboratory at the Central Experimental Farm — he would take me with him in the summers, because childcare was too expensive back then.</p>

  <p>I had access to cutting-edge computers and the internet — in 1994! I would surf strange things, like looking up the inside of a cow’s eyeball, and playing classical computer games.</p>

  <p>At lunchtime, he’d walk with me to the Central Farm, and we’d break walnuts open under the tree with rocks. I can still smell the bitter skins, feel the staining on my fingers. And the walnuts — were delicious.</p>

  <p>The feeling of being cared for...</p>

  <p>I remember his hearty Persian soups, stews, and dishes: ash reshteh, abgoosht, gheimeh, fesenjoon, ghormeh sabzi — and they were always delicious.</p>

  <p>In a world of fast food, he taught me about natural flavors, good combinations, and good health — something he cared deeply about.</p>

  <p>Fast forward to just last summer — I struggled to keep up with this 87-year-old man working in the field.</p>

  <p>I often had to take breaks — he was wearing me out! I mentioned my frustration, and later he texted: "I suggest you check your thyroid hormone levels. Most doctors assume all is well with young people."</p>

  <p>He was always thinking about how to help.</p>

  <p>The feeling of caring for the Earth...</p>

  <p>In a world of fast fashion, fast food, and hyper-consumerism, Dad produced almost no waste. He didn’t just say he was an environmentalist — he lived it.</p>

  <p>He avoided buying foods wrapped in plastic. He composted food scraps with worms — red wrigglers. He rarely bought new clothes, never chasing fashion trends.</p>

  <p>If you look at his wardrobe now, the newest item is probably 30 years old. He stuck with classic styles — tweed jackets, Italian suits — and he watched his weight, so he never needed a new wardrobe. (Something I think I should work on myself!)</p>

  <p>Lastly, I want to talk about his dream — his vision for Golestan Farm.</p>

  <p>He dreamed it would be an extension of his own life — a place where his children and grandchildren could enjoy the orchard. He wanted it to be an eco-hostel — a place where young people could stay and learn about organic farming. He wanted it to outlive him.</p>

  <p>He searched long and hard for the perfect place. He chose Portland, Ontario, largely to be close to his best friends, and because it was halfway between Ottawa and Toronto where his kids lived.</p>

  <p>He planted many trees — we planted many trees together. Emma even enjoyed planting trees with her grandfather a few years ago. Last year, Dad was proud to see the first mulberries ripening.</p>

  <p>We will continue that vision — growing food, welcoming friends, keeping his spirit alive in the land he loved.</p>

  <p>Please feel free to stop by Golestan Farm on Highway 15. Everyone is welcome who wants to learn about organic farming and a sustainable way of life.</p>

  <p>Thank you for coming today. I look forward to hearing your stories about my dad.</p>
