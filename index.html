      <h2>Eulogy by Azadeh Sabour</h2>
      Eulogy for Dr. Parviz Mohammad Sabour, by Azadeh Sabour

 

My father was just a few days shy of his 89th birthday when he drew his last breath. We used to joke that Parviz had nine lives, because he escaped death so many times throughout his life. It’s still truly hard to believe that he’s gone. In an instant. I miss him very much.

He was so vibrant and busy, lived life on his own terms, with so much determination, right up to his final days. He was baking bread and making stews, germinating seeds in his greenhouse to plant at his farm, and planning his latest trip to Iran, his home country, which he loved so much. He was developing research proposals with other scientists, funding lab research, and still giving scientific lectures, to name a few.

There are moments when grief overwhelms me. I’ve spent hours at his home, surrounded by photographs and mementos, reading your kind messages, and marveling at the stories and pictures you’ve shared.

I am deeply grateful for each memory and message—from friends, family, and colleagues around the world. My brothers and I are blessed by our mother’s loving support, by friends helping us plan this celebration, by my husband Chris’s beautiful photo reels, and by family and friends joining us from afar. With all of you, we are weaving a tapestry of our father’s life. Day by day, I am climbing upward and forward, discovering the beauty in his vibrant, remarkable story.

Today, I want to share that story with you. And as I do, I hope you’ll imagine him here – our professor - correcting my details, going off on tangents, smiling his biggest smile, and sharing his deep, joyful laugh.  

My father was born Mohammad Sabour in April 1936, the youngest of three brothers. He entered the world in Nowbahar, a village which has since become the bustling city of Mashhad, in Khorasan, northeastern Iran.

Those early years were unimaginably hard. My father’s mother loved her children so deeply, but the hardships of life meant she was unable to care for her three sons on her own. The boys were sent to live with relatives in Tehran. My father, still a baby, was adopted by a prominent judge and his wife who named him Parviz and raised him through adolescence. That family had a son, Farzad, who now lives in Frankfurt and remained close to my father. My father also stayed close with his birth mother and brothers. The eldest brother Hussein, passed away in Iran in the 1980s, however, Ali Asghar, now in his nineties, lives on in Montreal.

Life in Tehran was also hard. My father was three years old at the start of World War II. He was five when British and Soviet forces—with help from the U.S.—invaded and occupied Iran in 1941. The Allies sought to secure Iranian oil fields, establish border control and supply lines to the Soviet Union, and depose Reza Shah. This, combined with a poor harvest, caused a devastating famine between 1942 and 1944.

During the post war re-building in the 1950s and 60s, Iran received international assistance, including from USAID and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, which worked with Iranian institutions to improve agricultural practices and education – support that would go on to shape my father’s life.  

At 19, he completed a diploma at the Agricultural Teachers Training School in VarAAmeen, which prepared educators to help advance rural development. We have many pictures of my father during this time, some of which you’ll see today.

He excelled at school, and soon became a Farm Manager at an experimental vegetable and poultry farm, then worked as an Agriculture and Poultry Specialist at the Ministry of Agriculture in Rasht, northern Iran.

His academic success gave him an opportunity: acceptance into Utah State University. He completed a Bachelor of Science in Zoology in 1963, then moved on to the University of California, Berkely, where he completed a Doctor of Philosophy in Genetics.  

Berkeley in the 1960s was alive with progressive politics, civil rights, and the anti-Vietnam War movement. You’ll see photos my father took of the thousands of anti-war student protestors at the historic Stop the Draft Week in October 1967 – he was passionately anti-war and on the right side of history.

My father formed life-long friendships in Berkley, friendships that transcend time, distance, and life changes. Among them, Dale.

Dale Whiteside - a fashionable, blond-haired, blue-eyed Canadian who was deeply interested in ideas, culture, and the world. She was working in a science lab at Berkeley in 1964 and learning, of all things, Farsi. Dale and Parviz became best friends, shared wonderful youthful adventures, and travelled together to Iran in 1969, just after my father’s doctoral studies.

Dale found work at the Canadian Embassy in Tehran as an English/Farsi translator for Iranian students traveling to Canada. The friendship endured long after Dale left Tehran and returned to Canada.

In the early 1970s, my father began teaching as an Assistant Professor of Genetics and Molecular Biology at the National University of Iran. Not long after, he achieved full professorship.  

Along the way, he met my mother, Nahid. She was a beautiful young student with long dark wavy hair, who happened to take one of his genetics courses. Romantic bonds formed. Parviz and Nahid got married in January 1974. Twelve months later, I was born, followed a few years later by my brother, Arash.  My father’s career grew: he became one of the founders of the Institute of Biophysics and Biochemistry at the University of Tehran, training many students in the field of molecular genetics.

But again, political forces intervened. In 1979, the anti-Shah Iranian Revolution succeeded, and replaced Iran’s Western-backed monarchy with an Islamic Republic led by Ayatollah Khomeini. We lived under the new Islamic regime for months, experiencing an increasingly theocratic and totalitarian regime that sought to control every aspect of public life. Then things got even worse: Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, invaded Iran. We lived in constant fear. There were bombing campaigns every day.

My father decided it was safest to leave Iran. By good fortune, Dale and her husband Bruce – now members of Canada’s foreign service - were posted to Cairo and offered to take us in. My mother stayed behind for a few months to finish her degree in Biology. With two small children in tow and just a few bags, we fled one night by bus to Istanbul, then flew to Cairo into the warm embrace of Dale and Bruce. We lived with Dale and Bruce, and baby daughter Fiona, for several months until our landed immigrant papers were ready. Finally, we began our next journey: this time to Canada.

We flew to Montreal, where my uncle Ali Asghar had settled with his family after leaving Iran, himself. My father has told this story many times.  We arrived in Montreal in the dead of winter.  He had only enough Canadian dollars to share a taxi from the Montreal airport to his brother’s home. If his brother hadn’t opened the door on that cold wintery night, he did not have another plan. Thankfully, Ali Asghar was home and welcomed us. My uncle and his family were generous and kind, caring for us until my mother could join us too.

In 1981, we moved to Ottawa to start a new life.  Soon after, my parents welcomed another son, Camron. Those first years in Canada were difficult for our family, but through hard work and perseverance, my parents built meaningful careers, both dedicated to public service and to the advancement of scientific research and health.

Our family life became deeply intertwined with Dale, Bruce, and Fiona, which has been an enormous blessing. Fiona became the best sister you could imagine, and Dale and Bruce brought us so much kindness, joy, and comfort.

Imagine this: Just one month before my father passed away, he asked me to format his resume. It was 72 pages long, including all his scientific publications and citations. I managed to create an abridged copy that is 18 pages long. It’s available upon request. He made many contributions to humanity. He conducted extensive research and taught at universities including Ottawa, Carleton, Guelph, Purdue, and Harvard. He worked as a research scientist for the federal government at Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada in Ottawa and Guelph for nearly 30 years. He published more than 190 scientific articles, published books, gave hundreds of lectures around the world, and was a prominent member of many prestigious national and international scientific societies—including the first proud member of Phage Canada.

But as children, we didn’t really know all these details about our father’s life or his scientific achievements. Instead, he inspected our food, lectured us about prebiotics and probiotics, eating natural foods from the earth, limiting processed foods, and trying to keep a healthy gut microbiome. He encouraged us to drink kefir and fresh ginger tea with turmeric and pepper. He was curious about our poop and whether we had healthy bowel functions. He taught us how to play competitive backgammon and chess, how to make yogurt, how to grow a garden, and take care of our plants.

Hours after his sudden death, Camron and I sat in his farmhouse and walked around his beloved property, still in shock. It looked like a flea market. It turns out my father also loved retro gadgets. We found old vacuum cleaners, old computers, scanners, printers, cameras, dozens of cables, and my favourite, the vibrating machine astronauts used to exercise in space, called Der Triumph. I can picture him telling me about each obsolete tool, a gleam in his eye, a big full laugh, and somehow – a lesson always hidden in his stories.

But I shouldn’t have been surprised—one of my favourite memories with him was the blackout of 2003—one of the largest in North America. It lasted days. I took the bus from Toronto to Guelph to check on him. I didn’t need to worry. He had enough gadgets to survive an apocalypse. He set up a fire-burning BBQ to cook dinner in his backyard, then brought out a large telescope which we set up in a nearby park. Passersby joined us, marvelling at the night sky’s beauty.

He did that always: taught us to marvel at the world, showed us its beauty, even in the hardship. He did that as a father and grandfather, as a scientist, and as a joyful and loyal friend.

His ability to tell a good story made him an incredible mentor to so many. We have been overwhelmed by messages from former students and colleagues sharing his ability to inspire young minds, of his passion for science, his commitment to excellence, and his belief in using knowledge to improve the world around him. He was famous for showing his love and devotion by cooking for you, or handing you a plant that he’d grown from seed – so confident that you could nurture and care for it.

I will hold onto my father’s story, to his love, his lessons. When I listen to the exquisite operatic voice of Maria Callas that he loved so much, when I drink my kefir, when I water his plants, when I smell his hats. He’s with me.

My family and I thank you all for joining us today to reflect on and celebrate our father. Thank you.

      <h2>Tribute by Fiona McKean</h2>
      <p>What I will miss most about Parviz is his voice. If you close your eyes and really listen, I’m sure you can hear him:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>He’s telling you to put high-fat plain yogurt on that skin condition you’ve been ignoring.</li>
        <li>He’s explaining how phages kill viruses without harming other cells.</li>
        <li>He’s telling you to make your own ginger tea instead of buying the packets because really, Fiona, you’re losing most of the benefit once it’s in a mass-produced pack (fine! I’ll make my own ginger tea, Amu).</li>
        <li>He’s showing you how to make the best bread you’ve ever tasted.</li>
        <li>He’s telling your teenaged self to think from first principles and not follow blindly.</li>
        <li>He’s sharing the story, for the 500th time, about sailing to America and ending up at university in Utah living with a Mormon family and raising chickens for 25 cents an hour. Even in repetition, it’s still funny.</li>
        <li>He’s telling you that he loves you. He was so open with his love.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Love of life, love of humanity, love of curiosity. He was a Professor of love.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What a lovely voice, <br>
           Teaching us of life<br>
           Biology, virology, a history of strife.<br>
           Wondrous, ponderous <br>
           Calm and filled with resonance<br>
           A Professor of Love eternal.</p>

      <h2>Poetry Reading by Sepand Siassi &amp; Meghan Hanley</h2>
      <p><strong>Introduction to Persian Poetry:</strong><br>
       
Introduction to Persian Poetry:
Sepand: My name is Sepand Siassi. My parents, Dr. Fereydoun Siassi and Shahed Amiri have been very close friends with Parviz since the early 70s. My father met Parviz through mutual friends at the University of Tehran while Parviz was working at the Institute of Biochemistry & Biophysics. Our families have been very close for three generations, in Iran and in Canada. I’ve travelled from Barcelona, where I now live, to be here with you today and to represent my family.

Amu Parviz was like an uncle to my brother and I, and we both love him dearly. Throughout the day, I am constantly reminded of him and his wisdom. Normally, very few people outside your own immediate family leave such a lasting impression that you think of them every single day—but he did. The microscopic description of what happens when you brush your teeth… or when you drink a glass of kefir; how to make yogurt; how to manage my road rage; …… EVERY SINGLE TIME I see an insect, I’m reminded of Amu Parviz’s gentle voice telling me that this too was their home long before it became mine. I continue to cherish the beautiful citrus tree he bought as a gift for the birth of my son. He was not only one of the smartest people I knew, but also one of the kindest—truly gentle, deeply caring—and I miss him dearly.
Meghan: My name is Meghan Hanley. I first met Parviz at Dale, Bruce and Fiona’s house in Ottawa, over 20 years ago. That first night, he taught me that the best rice is at the bottom of the pot and had the whole table enraptured by his story of – yet another – near death experience. Parviz became part of the fabric of my life, and the lives of my children. He taught us to move slowly, to observe deeply, to ask why, and how and what if, and to have faith in the smallest seedling. Two years ago, Parviz gave us a small mulberry tree that he’d grown from a cutting. Days after he died, I realized that I’d left it out all winter, unprotected. It looked lifeless. I scratched the bark. Green. I placed it in the sun, fertilized it, watered it. Its leaves popped out yesterday. Life. Amu, I promise I’ll care for it.
Sepand and I are here to share a selection of Persian poems with you. Among the many things Parviz loved about Iran was its poetry. As I began to read the poets that Parviz knew so well, Dale said to me spontaneously: “In Iran, …poetry is life!”  Poetry is not just read in books: it’s quoted in everyday conversation, inscribed on buildings, woven into carpets, and recited at gatherings, like today.
Sepand: Persian poetry is the soul of its culture—deeply expressive and intertwined with daily life. Parviz had several favourite poets, including centuries-old Hafez, Rumi, and Ferdowsi.
He also deeply admired the poetry of Omar Khayyam - the 11th-century Persian poet, mathematician, and philosopher, best known for The Rubáiyát, which was translated into English and popularized by British writer, Edward FitzGerald, in the 1800s.
The book of Rubáiyát offers profound reflections in quatrains, or four-line poems. We will read a selection of them in Farsi, with artistic translations in English.
Quatrain 1 –
Sepand in Farsi:
 
Meghan: I’ll first read a literal English translation, and then the more lyrical Fitzgerald translation:

 
Quatrain 2 –
Sepand in Farsi: From Rubáiyát

Meghan in English:
“A cloud came and wept more over the grass
Without rose-coloured wine, life cannot pass
This grass that today is our place of delight
Whose dust will it be, when our time has passed?”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Quatrain 3 –
Sepand:

Meghan to read the English:
"With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow,
And with mine own hand labored it to grow;
And this was all the Harvest that I reap’d—
‘I came like Water, and like Wind I go."
 
Meghan: It’s truly incredible that the meanings of these poems continue to ring true hundreds of years after they were written.
We close with a beautiful and fitting poem inspired by Ferdowsi - one of the greatest and most influential figures in Persian literature and cultural history. While this poem is not a literal translation, it’s a modern interpretation that echoes themes that Ferdowsi powerfully conveys throughout his epic book called the Shahnameh (The Book of Kings). The Shahnameh, published in the 11th century, speaks to legacy, honor, and the enduring power of a good name—something many Iranians, especially of Parviz’s generation, held sacred.

      <h2>Speech by Dean Lucie Thibault</h2>
      At the University of Ottawa, we share Parviz's passion for understanding the role of the gut microbiome in health and in mental health in particular.
His support and advocacy meant a great deal to the University of Ottawa, to the Faculty of Health Sciences, as we built, from scratch, a new School of Nutrition Sciences and a food science undergraduate and graduate program.
It was a huge undertaking, led by Susan Tosh, who, like Krista, was a long-time colleague and friend of Parviz. It involved creating courses, building labs, and developing a collaborative research program.

We were also able to attract a critical mass of young researchers from a range of fields to drive progress in understanding the role that diet, nutrition, and the gut microbiome play in depression, anxiety, and other mental illness.
That is why we are pleased to announce that the University will name two scholarships in Parviz’s honour.
The Dr. Parviz Sabour Nutrition and Mental Health doctoral scholarship and the Dr. Parviz Sabour Nutrition and Mental Health master’s scholarship.
We believe it is a fitting tribute for Parviz as a man of science, a man who was always interested in learning and knowledge, and a man who always cared for students.

      <h2>Speech by Dr. Greg German</h2>
      Speech by Dr. Greg German
Good afternoon, I am Dr. Greg German Cofounder of Phage Canada, Physician and Professor of Bacteriophage Therapy at the University of Toronto.
Parviz was a phage in many ways.
Phages are bacterial viruses specific to bacteria, and Phage therapy is when we harness this potential to treat troubling, sticky, and deadly infections.  Phages target bad bacteria and go onto produce between 60 to 300 more phages right at the site of the infection.   Parviz would have been the 300. Parviz, had a pulse on where to do the greatest good, where to grow the best fruit, and be exponential in his outreach.
Dr. Hany Anany (Agriculture and Agri Food Canada, and scientist who took over Parviz’s laboratory in Guelph), is here today with 5 of his colleagues. He offers: “Your light, your generosity, and your spirit…  Parviz had a way of making everyone around him feel seen, valued, and inspired.  His deep knowledge, humility, and warmth touched so many lives, mine perhaps most deeply.  Your legacy will continue in every step I take and in every student and project touched by your influence.”
Phages out evolve bacteria. Parviz was able to out-evolve with the times, and like his interest in Chess, he was able to outthink, outcare, and overcome challenges, and typically three moves ahead.  He would also do this with kindness and a naturally disarming approach.
Also attending is Dr. Andrew Kropinski with his wife, Ms. Peggy Pritchard. They offer: “Ceaselessly curious, kind, generous, amusing, and inspiring friend. Gracious host with old world charm.  Discrete and respected philanthropy advisor and contributor… leading to major work in microbiome and a precision tool to modify the microbiome phage therapy into the original prebiotic.”  
Connector and a catalyst.  Like phages, Parviz could connect those that are most hungry for science with those that are most hungry for action.  Phages have a way of getting deep into prosthetic joints where no antibiotics can go and be persistent.  Parviz would provide that spark countless times.  He was the first member of the non-profit Phage Canada organization, which Dr. Alex Hynes and I co-founded, and he made a large donation to help jump start our group into the 70 members it is today, including 10 public members. 
Phages are timeless; they are the original retro-gadget. Prior to antibiotics 90 years ago, major companies like Ely Lily, Abbott, and Pasteur institute were producing phages to treat infections.
Parviz wanted us to all "Grow" and develop. I would learn so much about Anar or what is called Pomegranate in English, a symbol of fertility, blessings, and characterized by anti-ageing. This was something Parviz cherished, and he often carried seeds with him on his travels. Anar is popularly known for Anti-aging, and I would say the Anar worked for him in mind, body, and spirit.
My research group recently submitted our ground-breaking Canadian urinary tract infection clinical trial for publication and if accepted I would look to have this offered in his honour and memory.
We have lost one of our most dedicated Champions of so much goodness and knowledge, but his memory, his legacy, his smile, lives on in us and in who we touch.
Phage on Parviz.
