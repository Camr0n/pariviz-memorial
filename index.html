      Dr. Parviz Mohammad Sabour (1936–2025) was a pioneering geneticist, a devoted educator, and a beloved father and friend. Born in Mashhad, Iran, his life journey took him from rural villages and war-torn streets to world-renowned universities, where he shaped minds and advanced science. He held a PhD from UC Berkeley and was among the founders of the Institute of Biophysics and Biochemistry at the University of Tehran.

      Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Parviz immigrated to Canada, where he continued his scientific work at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, as well as universities including Ottawa, Carleton, Guelph, and Harvard. He published over 190 scientific papers and was deeply involved in promoting Iranian-Canadian scientific collaboration. He inspired students with his passion for molecular biology, virology, and the gut microbiome, always emphasizing the connection between science, food, and health.

      Beyond science, Parviz was a lover of Persian poetry, classical music, and gardening. He believed in living with curiosity and purpose, often gifting plants he nurtured from seed and offering health advice laced with humor and wisdom. He was a storyteller, a teacher, a mentor, and above all, a man of deep integrity and love. He was known to counsel friends and family alike to drink kefir, make their own ginger tea, and observe life’s wonders, even in a spoonful of yogurt.

      His warmth and intellect left an indelible mark on all who knew him. As remembered by family and friends, he was “a Professor of Love”—a man whose legacy is not just in academic contributions, but in the way he cared, taught, and uplifted those around him. Today and always, we remember Parviz not just for what he accomplished, but for who he was: kind, brilliant, generous, and full of life.
