      <h2>Eulogy by Azadeh Sabour</h2>
      <p>My father was just a few days shy of his 89th birthday when he drew his last breath. We used to joke that Parviz had nine lives, because he escaped death so many times throughout his life. It’s still truly hard to believe that he’s gone. In an instant. I miss him very much.</p>
      <p>He was so vibrant and busy, lived life on his own terms, with so much determination, right up to his final days. He was baking bread and making stews, germinating seeds in his greenhouse to plant at his farm, and planning his latest trip to Iran, his home country, which he loved so much. He was developing research proposals with other scientists, funding lab research, and still giving scientific lectures, to name a few.</p>
      <p>There are moments when grief overwhelms me. I’ve spent hours at his home, surrounded by photographs and mementos, reading your kind messages, and marveling at the stories and pictures you’ve shared.</p>
      <p>I am deeply grateful for each memory and message—from friends, family, and colleagues around the world. My brothers and I are blessed by our mother’s loving support, by friends helping us plan this celebration, by my husband Chris’s beautiful photo reels, and by family and friends joining us from afar. With all of you, we are weaving a tapestry of our father’s life. Day by day, I am climbing upward and forward, discovering the beauty in his vibrant, remarkable story.</p>
      <p>Today, I want to share that story with you. And as I do, I hope you’ll imagine him here – our professor - correcting my details, going off on tangents, smiling his biggest smile, and sharing his deep, joyful laugh.</p>
      <p>My father was born Mohammad Sabour in April 1936, the youngest of three brothers. He entered the world in Nowbahar, a village which has since become the bustling city of Mashhad, in Khorasan, northeastern Iran.</p>
      <p>Those early years were unimaginably hard. My father’s mother loved her children so deeply, but the hardships of life meant she was unable to care for her three sons on her own...</p>

      <h2>Tribute by Fiona McKean</h2>
      <p>What I will miss most about Parviz is his voice. If you close your eyes and really listen, I’m sure you can hear him:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>He’s telling you to put high-fat plain yogurt on that skin condition you’ve been ignoring.</li>
        <li>He’s explaining how phages kill viruses without harming other cells.</li>
        <li>He’s telling you to make your own ginger tea instead of buying the packets because really, Fiona, you’re losing most of the benefit once it’s in a mass-produced pack (fine! I’ll make my own ginger tea, Amu).</li>
        <li>He’s showing you how to make the best bread you’ve ever tasted.</li>
        <li>He’s telling your teenaged self to think from first principles and not follow blindly.</li>
        <li>He’s sharing the story, for the 500th time, about sailing to America and ending up at university in Utah living with a Mormon family and raising chickens for 25 cents an hour. Even in repetition, it’s still funny.</li>
        <li>He’s telling you that he loves you. He was so open with his love.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Love of life, love of humanity, love of curiosity. He was a Professor of love.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What a lovely voice, <br>
           Teaching us of life<br>
           Biology, virology, a history of strife.<br>
           Wondrous, ponderous <br>
           Calm and filled with resonance<br>
           A Professor of Love eternal.</p>
